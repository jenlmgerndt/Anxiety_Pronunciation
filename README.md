Code for data analysis of Jennifer Gerndt's PhD dissertation in Linguistics, with help from Mel Chua. We are both (at the time of this project) PhD students at Purdue University.

The research project is exploring various connections between self-reported anxiety and pronunciation accuracy for university-level learners of German. 

The data itself is private, protected by IRB. The code, however, is written to be simple enough for a new programmer to work with (hence the using of Excel as a database) and we'll endeavour to make it as readable and reusable as possible, though we suspect this won't be understandable/useful to people who aren't us. That's okay. 

Jen is learning programming and math (statistics and other things related to doing the quantitative portion of mix-methods research) so there will be math notes in here as well. The documentation (in the code, and elsewhere) is in German, because Mel is learning the language.

We have not picked a license yet, but will do so. It might be the GPL v.3.
